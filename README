Open City Street Map
--------------------

ocitysmap generates a city street map, using the OpenStreetMap project's data
and the MapNik map renderer. The generated maps are vector graphics images,
including a street index and city grid.

For example, for a simple Sanguinet rendering, run:
 ./render.py Sanguinet 44.4883,-1.0901 44.4778,-1.0637
