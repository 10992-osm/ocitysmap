Open City Street Map
--------------------

ocitysmap generates a city street map, using the OpenStreetMap project's data
and the MapNik map renderer. The generated maps are vector graphics images,
including a street index and city grid.

For example, for a simple Sanguinet rendering, run:

 ./ocitysmap-render -f png Sanguinet

Alternately you may specify a bounding box rather than a City:

 ./ocitysmap-render -f png -b 44.4883,-1.0901 44.4778,-1.0637

This is useful when OpenStreetMap does not contain the administrative boundary
of the city.

You should first create /etc/ocitysmap.conf and/or ~/.ocitysmap from the
template ocitysmap.conf.
